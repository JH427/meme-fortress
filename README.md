# 🧠 Meme Fortress

A multiplayer tile-based base-building simulator powered by chaos, cringe, and cursed AI agents.

Meme Fortress blends the colony-sim vibes of Dwarf Fortress with modern absurdity. You and your friends give vague instructions to unstable AI agents—who misinterpret them based on their personality traits and desperately try to survive on copium and cringe.

## 🚀 Features

- 🗺️ Tile-Based World: Click to build structures like `cringe_mine`, `copium_field`, and more  
- 🤖 Autonomous AI Agents: Each with traits like `chaotic`, `doomer`, or `clout chaser`  
- 🧭 Agent Behavior Logic: Clout chasers seek copium. Doomers spiral. Chaos agents build meme shrines without permission  
- 💬 Speech Bubbles: Agents shout their thoughts and vibes in real-time  
- 🧼 Collision Logic: Agents can't stack—unless something breaks  
- 💨 Smooth Interpolation: Agents don’t teleport, they slide with style  
- 🖼️ Image-Based Sprites: Replaceable agent icons for ultimate customizability

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Open the game in your browser  
2. Click on any tile to build something: `structure`, `cringe_mine`, or `copium_field`  
3. Agents will wander, seek resources, and speak their minds  
4. Enter prompts like `build copium_field at 2,3` in the text input for direct chaos injection
